## JavaScript Assignments
Under the `homework-automated` folder you'll find a `homework.js` file which exposes empty methods for associates to implement. Once the methods are implemented, use Jasmine to run the
`spec/HomeworkSpec.js` file with the tests:
```bash
npm i -g jasmine # if you don't have it already
cd ./homework-automated
jasmine ./spec/HomeworkSpec.js
```
Jasmine will run through the unit tests with the designated test cases and output the results to the console.
